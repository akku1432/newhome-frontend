LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

📍 WHERE TO PLACE YOUR LOGO:

Place your company logo file in this folder (newhome-frontend/public/)


📝 FILE NAME:

Name your logo file: logo.png

Supported formats:
- PNG (recommended - supports transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG


📐 RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS:

Size: 512x512 pixels
Format: PNG with transparent background
Max file size: 500KB
Aspect ratio: Square or horizontal (1:1 or 16:9)


🎨 DESIGN TIPS:

✓ Use high resolution for clarity

✓ Keep it simple and professional
✓ Test on mobile devices


📂 FILE STRUCTURE:

newhome-frontend/
└── public/
    ├── logo.png          ← Place your logo here
    ├── index.html
    ├── manifest.json
    └── LOGO_INSTRUCTIONS.txt (this file)


🔄 ALTERNATIVE FILE NAMES:

If you want to use a different filename (e.g., company-logo.png):

1. Place your logo in this folder with your preferred name
2. Open: newhome-frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx
3. Find line with: src="/logo.png"
4. Replace "logo.png" with your filename


✅ VERIFY IT WORKS:

1. Place logo in public folder
2. Start frontend: npm start
3. Check the Hero section (top of page)
4. Logo should appear in a white rounded square


❌ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Logo not showing?
- Check filename is exactly "logo.png" (case-sensitive)
- Verify file is in public folder, not src folder
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Check file permissions
- Try JPG format if PNG doesn't work


💡 NO LOGO YET?

The website will show a placeholder "NH" logo until you add your actual logo file.
Everything else will work perfectly!
